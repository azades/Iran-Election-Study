Iran Election Study
-------------------
In this study, we aim tried to understand how one social network is being used in the context of an election in Iran 
and how information flows in thea community of social media users who were involved in the discussion of Iran.

The focus of this study is on data collected from Twitter as a popular social media outletnetwork  among Iranians 
for sharing news and updates. Twitter has been the subject of many studies after the 2009 election in Iran as some 
media outlets praised social networks as the main catalyst in the social and political movements.

In this study, we have provided a statistical review of user population participating in the discussion of Iran 
during the 2013 election. We have looked at the language distribution of tweets and the software platforms used by users.
To understand the changes in the number of tweets for each day, we attempted to find the correlations between tweets 
rate change and events in the election season.
